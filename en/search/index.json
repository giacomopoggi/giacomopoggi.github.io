[{"content":"Pyava is a simple emulator launcher that I wrote in the october of 2017 using Python (more precisely Python 3), the programming language I was studying at the time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a portable and convenient menu to run all your games from a single place.\nIts creation was inspired by Yava, a similar utility written in C# (and the name Pyava itself is the crasis of the words Python and Yava).\nThe entire project can be found on GitHub.\nPyava running on Windows 10 Keyboard shortcuts\nKey Use Esc Close the program. Tab Change between the left and right panel. Ctrl+A Show an information message. Ctrl+R Reload config.ini without closing the program. Ctrl+S Set a custom separator for splitting parameters. Configuration\nPyava is configured using a file named \u0026ldquo;config.ini\u0026rdquo;. This file contains everything Pyava needs to know about the folders and files it will launch.\nHere is an example that generates the screenshot above:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [Game Boy] games = C:\\Games\\Game Boy\\ executable = C:\\Emulators\\BGB\\bgb.exe extensions = .zip, .gb [Nintendo Entertainment System] games = C:\\Games\\Nintendo Entertainment System\\ executable = C:\\Emulators\\Mesen\\Mesen.exe extensions = .7z parameters = /fullscreen, /DoNotSaveSettings Parameters and extensions are separated by \u0026ldquo;,\u0026rdquo;. You can set a custom separator using the apposite keyboard shortcut, but it resets to \u0026ldquo;,\u0026rdquo; every time you select a different platform from the list.\n","date":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://giacomopoggi.com/en/p/pyava-en/pyava-default-image_hud0b9bf71b448ced5f6a4c8535a8e3de2_48258_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://giacomopoggi.com/en/p/pyava-en/","title":"Pyava: a simple emulator launcher written in Python"}]
